# Overview
The tournament creator app was created to assist with the creation and running of a wargaming event, specifically running events for the wargame Middle Earth SBG. I ran a couple of small events before creating this app and used pen and paper to record results and determine match-ups. However, when I knew I was going to be running the final event in the Great British Hobbit League 2018 calendar, I knew that I would have to find an alternative method. Following my research of some existing options that other tournament organizers used, I decided to create my own app which would be customized to my requirements. After using the app at several events I continued to develop it, correcting bugs and adding additional features where required.

# Code
This program was created using C++ in QtCreator 5.9. The GUI was created using QtCreator.

# Program Output
The Tournament Creator application is designed to help with the running of Middle Earth SBG tournaments. When the program is ran you will be able to either create a new event or load a previous event, which is saved as a .json file. If you create a new event the program will run your through each step of the tournament creation. The user will then be able to use the program to run each round of the event, and at the end of the event the program will calculate the final standings.

# How To Build/Run

2) Place the project in a suitable location and un-zip.
